# Monolith

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2024-06-05

## Context and Problem Statement

I need a way to run Articleman without paying for thousands of dollars for compute, while keeping everything as reliable as possible. Lock-in must be avoided.

## Considered Options

* "Serverless" microservices
* Bare metal microservices
* "Serverless" monolith
* Bare metal monolith

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Bare metal monolith", because it has the least overhead and least lock-in.
